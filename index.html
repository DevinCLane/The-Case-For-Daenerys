      <h3 id="headline">The case for our queen:</h3>
      <li>She birthed three dragons. So cool.</li>
      <li>She is the breaker of chains: she liberated the slaves of Slaver's Bay.</li>
      <li>As Khaleesi, she led the Dothraki to cross the "poison water" with "wooden horses", something not even the greatest Khal had achieved.</li>
      <li>She is unburnt. Not even fire can take her down. So cool.</li>
      <li>She saves Jon Snow and his men when they are trapped by the army of the dead. She lost a dragon for them! This shows a commitment to caring for her people.</li>
      <li>Way nicer than Cersei</li>
      <li>She birthed three dragons. So cool!</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names. I have been sold like a broodmare. I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea. They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms, and I will."</p>
